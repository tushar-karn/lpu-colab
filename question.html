    <h1>Single File Programming Question</h1>
    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>
        You are tasked with developing a program that calculates the total and average marks for a class of students. The program takes the input for the number of students in the class, followed by their respective names and marks in three subjects: Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. The program then calculates the total marks and average marks for each student, as well as the total marks and average marks for the entire class.</p>


<p>Create a class named Marks with data members for roll number, name, and marks. Create three other classes inheriting the Marks class, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, which are used to define marks in the individual subjects of each student. The roll number for each student will be generated automatically.</p>


<p>Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Infosys recruitment.</p>
Input format :

The first line of input contains an integer, 'n', representing the number of students in the class.

      iFrames in HTML iFrames, or Inline Frames, are an integral part of modern
      web development. They allow you to embed another HTML page within your
      current page. In this blog, we'll delve into the utility of iFrames, their
      attributes, and some use-cases. What is an iFrame? An iFrame is an HTML
      element that enables an inline frame for the embedding of external
      content. Essentially, you can load another web page within a designated
      area of your current webpage. Why Use iFrames? iFrames offer a variety of
      use-cases: Content Isolation: iFrames allow you to isolate third-party
      content, which can improve security. Modularity: Easily embed external
      plugins, widgets, or content. Resource Separation: Content within an
      iFrame can load separately from the rest of the page. Basic Syntax The
      basic syntax of an iFrame is quite straightforward:

      <!-- <iframe src="URL" width="width" height="height"></iframe>
      Attributes of iFrame Several attributes can enhance the functionality of
      an iFrame: src: Specifies the URL of the page to embed. height and width:
      Define the dimensions. frameborder: Indicates whether to display a border.
      scrolling: Controls the scrollbars. name: For targeting the iFrame in
      JavaScript. Practical Examples Embedding a YouTube Video

      Conclusion iFrames offers a convenient way to embed external content into
      your web pages. Their flexibility and ease of use make them an invaluable
      tool for modern web development.
